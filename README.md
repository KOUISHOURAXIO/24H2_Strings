- Each Windows build has its own values ​​in parameters (palaces, thongs, and so on), but sometimes they can coincide even with different builds. The largest difference can be seen if you compare different versions of Windows (7/10/11) (Windows Server 2022+ Kernel from Windows 11)
- All that you do at your own peril and risk for harm to the computer.
